Overview

A fast and simple streaming zip file downloader for PHP.  Here's a
simple example:

    # create a new zipstream object
    $zip = new ZipStream('example.zip');

    # create a file named 'hello.txt' 
    $zip->add_file('some_image.jpg', 'This is the contents of hello.txt');

    # add a file named 'image.jpg' from a local file 'path/to/image.jpg'
    $zip->add_file_from_path('some_image.jpg', 'path/to/image.jpg');

    # finish the zip stream
    $zip->finish();

You can also add comments, modify file timestamps, and customize (or
disable) the HTTP headers.  See the class file for details.  There are a
couple of additional examples in the initial release announcement at the
